## Draw the Mouse: Public Domain Celebration

A creative web project celebrating the historic entry of Steamboat Willie-era Mickey Mouse into the public domain on January 1, 2024, marking a significant milestone in copyright law and creative freedom after 95 years.

### The Moment

On January 1, 2024, the original Mickey Mouse from *Steamboat Willie* (1928) entered the public domain, becoming freely available for creative reuse, remixing, and reinterpretation for the first time in nearly a century.

### The Project

**Draw the Mouse** marked this cultural milestone with:
- Timed launch coinciding with the midnight transition
- Community participation and creative submissions
- Educational resources about public domain importance
- Celebration of creative commons enrichment

### Why It Matters

#### Cultural Heritage
After sufficient time, creative works should return to the public commons where they can:
- Inspire new generations of creators
- Be freely referenced and remixed
- Contribute to shared cultural vocabulary
- Enable artistic expression without legal barriers

#### Creative Freedom
Public domain enables:
- New interpretations and adaptations
- Educational use without licensing
- Preservation of cultural history
- Democratic access to cultural works

### Technical Implementation

- **Python-based web application**
- **Timed for the transition moment**
- **Community engagement features**
- **Educational content about copyright and public domain**

### Impact

This project celebrated the principle that cultural works, after protecting creator interests for a reasonable period, should ultimately belong to everyoneâ€”enriching our shared creative landscape and ensuring cultural heritage remains accessible.
