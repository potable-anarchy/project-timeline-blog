### Technical Approach

#### Preservation Strategy
- Complete legacy codebase archived
- Database schema analysis and documentation
- Incremental feature migration
- Comprehensive testing for data integrity

#### New Architecture
- PHP MVC framework
- Enhanced data validation
- Responsive design implementation
- Automated SQLite backup system

### Key Challenges

- **Pattern Translation**: Converting ColdFusion-specific patterns to PHP equivalents
- **Data Integrity**: Ensuring no loss during migration
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Maintaining URL structure and functionality
- **Historical Accuracy**: Preserving decades of outdoor education records

### Results

Successfully modernized the platform while maintaining complete historical data, ensuring the content remains accessible and maintainable for future outdoor enthusiasts. Legacy code preserved in separate repository for reference.

### Technical Stack
