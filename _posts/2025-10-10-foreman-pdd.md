## Foreman-PDD: Meta-Builder AI Agent

**Winner of the Vibe-Kanban Track at Dedalus Hackathon (10/10/2025, San Francisco)**

A meta-builder agent that orchestrates Prompt-Driven Development (PDD)—generating working software from natural language specifications by coordinating specialized AI agents. Built *with* PDD to prove the concept.

### What is Prompt-Driven Development?

**Traditional**: Developer writes code  
**PDD**: AI agents generate code from specifications

Foreman-PDD acts as the conductor, orchestrating specialized sub-agents to transform project specs into working software through task decomposition and coordinated generation.

### The Meta Approach

**Self-Referential**: Foreman-PDD was built using the methodology it implements, demonstrating PDD viability by building itself with AI-driven development.

### Architecture

#### Agent Orchestration System
```
Specification → Foreman → [Architect | Developer | Test | Integration] → Working Software
```

#### Specialized Agents
- **Architect Agent**: System design and structure
- **Developer Agents**: Code generation for components
- **Test Agent**: Validation and quality checks
- **Integration Agent**: Component assembly

### How It Works

1. **Parse Specification**: Extract requirements from natural language
2. **Decompose Tasks**: Break project into agent-sized units
3. **Assign Agents**: Route tasks to specialized agents
4. **Generate Code**: Parallel component creation
5. **Integrate & Validate**: Assembly and testing
6. **Deliver**: Working software output

### Technical Implementation

- **TypeScript-based orchestration**
- **Agent communication protocol**
- **Shared context management**
- **State synchronization**
- **Quality control pipeline**

### Key Challenges Solved

- **Agent coordination** across parallel tasks
- **Context preservation** between agent handoffs
- **Task decomposition** from ambiguous specs
- **Result integration** from multiple agents
- **Quality assurance** at generation time

### Hackathon Win

Foreman-PDD won the **Vibe-Kanban Track** at the SF Tech Week Agent Builders Hackathon by demonstrating:
- Practical agent coordination
- Real code generation
- Meta-level validation (built with itself)
- Novel approach to AI-assisted development

### Use Cases

#### Rapid Prototyping
- Quick proof-of-concepts
- Idea validation
- Technology exploration
- Learning new stacks

#### Production Development
- Boilerplate generation
- Standard implementations
- Testing infrastructure
- Documentation creation

### Future Vision

- Enhanced specification parsing (better natural language understanding)
- More specialized agents (security, performance, accessibility)
- Agent learning from past projects
- Multi-language support expansion

### Impact

This project explores the frontier of AI-assisted software development, demonstrating that properly coordinated AI agents can handle complex software creation tasks. The meta-approach validates PDD as a methodology worth investigating for developer productivity.
