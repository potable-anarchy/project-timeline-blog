## Roast My Wallet: AI Wallet Roaster

An AI-powered analyzer that reads crypto wallet transaction history and delivers brutally honest, comedic roasts about trading decisions. Created during a vibe-coding hackathon at Frontier Tower in San Francisco.

### The Concept

**Input**: Wallet address  
**Output**: AI-generated savage commentary on:
- Questionable token purchases
- Buying high, selling low patterns
- Gas fee disasters
- FOMO trading behavior
- Overall portfolio choices

### Example Output

*"You bought $SAFEMOON at the peak? That's not a trading strategy, that's performance art. Your wallet has more red flags than a communist parade."*

### Technical Implementation

#### Architecture
- **TypeScript frontend** for wallet input
- **Blockchain APIs** for transaction history
- **AI integration** for roast generation
- **Pattern analysis** for trading behavior

#### Analysis Engine
- Transaction history parsing
- Win/loss ratio calculation
- Gas fee analysis
- Token selection patterns
- Timing analysis (buying peaks, selling dips)

### AI Roasting System

The AI generates context-aware humor by:
- Recognizing common trading mistakes
- Referencing crypto culture and memes
- Maintaining entertainment value
- Personalizing based on wallet history

### Use Cases

- **Entertainment**: Share roasts on social media
- **Education**: Learn from mistakes through humor
- **Community**: Crypto culture commentary
- **Self-awareness**: Recognize bad patterns humorously

### Privacy & Data

- Uses only **public blockchain data**
- No personal information required
- Anonymous wallet analysis
- No data storage

### Hackathon Context

Built at a vibe-coding event focused on rapid prototyping and creative blockchain applications. Demonstrates that Web3 tooling can be approachable and entertaining beyond financial speculation.

### Impact

This project shows how AI and blockchain data can combine for entertainment while subtly educating users about trading patterns and risk management through humor rather than lectures.
