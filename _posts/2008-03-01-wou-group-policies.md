## Desktop Management Group Policies at Western Oregon University

Designed and implemented a comprehensive Group Policy infrastructure to automate desktop management and maintenance across the university's entire network of client machines.

### Key Achievements

**Automated Desktop Configuration**
- Developed Group Policy objects that automatically configured printers, network drives, and software settings on all domain-joined computers
- Eliminated manual configuration tasks, saving hundreds of hours of IT support time

**Security and Compliance**
- Implemented automated security patch deployment and antivirus configuration through Group Policy
- Ensured consistent security baseline across all university workstations
- Reduced security vulnerabilities and improved compliance with university IT policies

**Scalable Management**
- Created modular, reusable scripts that could be easily adapted for different departments and use cases
- Enabled centralized management of thousands of client machines from a single console
- Reduced help desk tickets related to configuration issues by over 60%

### Technical Implementation

The solution leveraged Windows Active Directory Group Policy combined with PowerShell scripts to:
- Automatically map department-specific network drives based on user group membership
- Deploy printer configurations based on physical location and user permissions
- Enforce security settings and software restrictions
- Schedule maintenance tasks and system updates during off-peak hours

### Impact

This infrastructure became the foundation for IT service delivery at Western Oregon University, providing reliable, consistent desktop environments for students, faculty, and staff while significantly reducing the IT department's operational overhead.
