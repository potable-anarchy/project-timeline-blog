## Velvet Ink: Statement Tights for Confident Women

Co-founded Velvet Ink, a statement tights brand featuring custom designs by Soo, an underground artist and activist. Each design carries bold messaging like "BITE ME," "NOT YOURS," and "LUIGI IS MY VALENTINE"—wearable art for women who refuse to blend in.

### My Role at Launch

As co-founder, I established the initial business foundation:

- **Amazon Storefront Development** - Built and optimized product listings from scratch
- **Design Collaboration** - Worked with Soo to translate artistic vision into manufacturable products
- **Copywriting & Positioning** - Crafted brand voice and product descriptions that resonate with our target audience
- **Operations Setup** - Established inventory, fulfillment, and customer service systems

### Product Line

Currently offering **6 distinctive designs** with new releases planned each season. Each pair of tights combines:

- **Bold artistic statements** that spark conversation
- **Quality materials** for comfort and durability
- **Empowering messaging** that celebrates confidence and individuality

### Target Market

Women who want to make a statement—who see fashion as self-expression, not conformity. Our customers value:

- Unique, artist-designed pieces
- Bold messaging that reflects their values
- High-quality products from independent brands

### Business Model

- **Direct-to-consumer** via Amazon marketplace
- **Seasonal releases** to maintain freshness and urgency
- **Artist collaboration** model showcasing Soo's underground aesthetic
- **Scalable operations** built for growth

### Launch Success

Successfully launched the brand on Amazon with initial product line and established foundation for growth. The combination of Soo's artistic vision and direct-to-consumer approach validated market demand for statement tights.

### What Makes Velvet Ink Different

In a market dominated by generic hosiery, Velvet Ink brings genuine artistic perspective and social commentary. These aren't just tights—they're wearable statements created by a real artist with something to say.

### Evolution

In August 2025, I transitioned into the role of Creative Director, taking on strategic leadership for brand direction and product expansion.
