## kmdr.ai: Command-Line Intelligence

An AI-powered tool that explains command-line operations in plain English, helping developers understand unfamiliar commands, debug complex pipelines, and learn shell scripting through instant, context-aware explanations.

### The Problem

Developers constantly encounter unfamiliar commands in documentation, scripts, and Stack Overflow answers. Traditional approaches require:
- Manual lookup of man pages
- Searching multiple syntax references
- Trial-and-error testing
- Piecing together cryptic flags and options

### The Solution

**Instant AI Explanations**: Paste any command and get immediate breakdown of:
- What the command does
- Flag and option meanings
- Potential side effects
- Security considerations

**Example**:
```bash
find . -name "*.log" -mtime +30 -delete
```
**AI Explains**: "Finds all .log files in current directory and subdirectories that were modified more than 30 days ago and deletes them. WARNING: This permanently deletes files without confirmation."

### Technical Implementation

- **Python Backend**: Command parsing and analysis engine
- **AI Integration**: Natural language processing for explanations
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Color-coded command breakdown
- **Multi-Shell Support**: bash, zsh, fish, PowerShell compatibility

### Use Cases

- **Learning**: Understand commands from tutorials and documentation
- **Debugging**: Decode complex pipelines and script logic
- **Code Review**: Explain shell scripts to team members
- **Security**: Identify potentially dangerous operations before running

### Impact

This tool bridges the gap between expert shell users and those still learning, making the command line more accessible while promoting safer practices through understanding rather than blind copy-paste.
