## Taking the Creative Lead at Velvet Ink

Eight months after co-founding Velvet Ink, I transitioned into the role of **Creative Director**, taking on comprehensive leadership of the brand's strategic direction, operations, and growth.

### Expanded Responsibilities

As Creative Director, I now oversee all aspects of the business:

**Strategic Vision**
- Guide overall brand direction and positioning
- Plan seasonal product releases and design strategy
- Collaborate with artist Soo to curate design pipeline
- Identify market opportunities and expansion paths

**Operations Leadership**
- Manage end-to-end operations: inventory, fulfillment, customer service
- Optimize Amazon storefront performance and conversion
- Handle supplier relationships and production coordination
- Monitor business metrics and financial performance

**Brand Development**
- Evolve brand voice and messaging
- Develop marketing strategies and customer acquisition
- Build customer community and engagement
- Position Velvet Ink for long-term growth

### Growth Focus

With the foundation established in December 2024, the Creative Director role allows me to:

- **Scale the product line** strategically with seasonal drops
- **Strengthen brand identity** beyond individual designs
- **Build sustainable operations** that support expansion
- **Explore new channels** while optimizing Amazon presence
- **Deepen artist collaboration** to maintain authentic voice

### Current Product Portfolio

Managing **6 signature designs** with continuous pipeline development:
- "BITE ME" - Bold defiance
- "NOT YOURS" - Bodily autonomy statement
- "LUIGI IS MY VALENTINE" - Cultural commentary
- Plus 3 additional statement pieces

### Business Philosophy

Leading Velvet Ink means balancing artistic integrity with commercial success. Every decision—from design selection to copy to operations—must serve both Soo's creative vision and our customers' desire for meaningful statement pieces.

### The Intersection of Art and Commerce

As Creative Director, I bridge the gap between underground art and mainstream e-commerce. It's about making activist art accessible and profitable while preserving its edge and authenticity.

### What's Next

Continuing to scale operations, expand the design catalog, and establish Velvet Ink as the definitive statement tights brand. Each season brings new opportunities to push boundaries and empower customers through wearable art.
