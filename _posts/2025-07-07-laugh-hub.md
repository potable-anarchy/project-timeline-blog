## Laugh-Hub: Intelligent Event Aggregation

A comedy event platform that solved the web scraping maintainability problem by replacing 20+ venue-specific regex parsers with a single AI-powered scraper that understands context and adapts to website changes automatically.

### The Problem

Traditional web scraping for event aggregation:
- Breaks every time venue websites change CSS selectors
- Requires custom parser for each venue
- Struggles with irregular data formats
- Maintenance overhead exceeds development time

### The AI Solution

**Single Intelligent Scraper**: One AI-powered service handles all venues by:
- Understanding page context like humans do
- Extracting event data regardless of layout changes
- Filtering garbage data (navigation links, non-events)
- Adapting without code updates

**Cost vs Maintainability**: ~$5-10/day for AI processing vs constant developer time maintaining brittle scrapers.

### Architecture

#### Main Application (SvelteKit)
- Event browsing and search interface
- Admin panel for venue management
- Supabase PostgreSQL database
- Vercel deployment with analytics

#### AI Scraper Microservice
- Playwright browser automation
- GPT-4 intelligent parsing
- Railway deployment
- API authentication and rate limiting

**Why Separate Service?**
- Heavy browser automation isolated from main app
- Independent scaling and cost control
- Technology-specific environment (Playwright)
- Clear separation of concerns

### Technical Implementation

```javascript
// AI understands context vs rigid CSS selectors
const events = await ai.extract(pageContent, {
  instruction: "Find comedy shows with dates, times, performers",
  schema: eventSchema
});
// No CSS selectors to maintain, no brittle parsing
```

### Key Features

- **Multi-venue aggregation** across comedy clubs
- **Intelligent deduplication** of events
- **Admin interface** for venue URL management
- **Event validation** preventing garbage data
- **Automated daily scraping** via GitHub Actions

### Results

- **Production site** live at [laugh-hub.com](https://laugh-hub.com)
- **Zero maintenance** for website layout changes
- **Easy expansion** - add venues without writing scrapers
- **High data quality** through AI context understanding

### Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: SvelteKit
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **AI Scraper**: Node.js + Playwright + GPT-4
- **Deployment**: Vercel (main), Railway (scraper)
- **Automation**: GitHub Actions

### Impact

This project demonstrates that AI can replace traditionally brittle systems (web scraping) with maintainable, intelligent solutions. The architecture serves as a model for content aggregation where source formats vary or change frequently.
